# Project Requirements
## Requirements 1: UI Functionality
1. Textbox for user to input time in seconds after which the robots should start moving.
1. Checkbox to select simultaneous or sequential movement.
1. Checkbox to allow user to repeat the task every 2 minutes.
1. Button to start the simulation.

## Requirements 2: Robot Movement
1. When the set time is reached, the software should trigger the robots in the simulators to start moving based on the user's choice, either simultaneously or sequentially.
1. If a robot is already moving, it should not accept new movement commands until the current movement is complete.

## Requirements 3: Robot Simulators
1. Use Turtlesim for the robot simulators.
1. The first robot should draw a rectangle.
1. The second robot should draw a triangle.

## Technical Requirements
1. The software should be written in any programming languages.
1. The code should be well-documented and commented.

## Evaluation Criteria
1. Functionality: Whether all required features are implemented.
1. Code Quality: Clarity of the code structure, presence of sufficient comments.
1. User Experience: Friendliness and usability of the UI, simplicity of operation.
1. Innovation: Any additional features or improvements beyond the basic requirements.

## Submission requirements
1. Package all code files into a zip archive.
1. Provide a README file with detailed instructions on how to run the software and use the simulators.
1. Submit a short video demonstrating the usage of the software and the simulators in action.
